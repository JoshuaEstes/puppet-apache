# Apache Puppet Module

This module is used to install, configure, and manage apache2 service
on a Ubuntu machine. It may work on other machines, but I have not
tested it.

# Install using composer

This module can be installed using composer. You will need to define the
repository and require this module. For more information on using composer
to install puppet modules see [github.com/JoshuaEstes/ComposerInstallerPuppet](https://github.com/JoshuaEstes/ComposerInstallerPuppet).
